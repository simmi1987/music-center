<h2>About Us</h2>
	<div style="text-align: center"><img src="images/TCMCbannerExtract3501002.jpg"></div>
	<p>The Townsville Community Music Centre was established in 1983 with the aim of fostering music in Townsville. In the beginning the focus was on promoting private music tuition and music education in schools. 
	This battle was won many years ago and the focus has moved towards general assistance to local musicians, both amateur and professional.</p>
	<p>Currently, typical activities include hosting concerts and workshops, assisting musicians and other music organisations in promotions, communication, and funding, and acting as local agents for visiting professionals. 
	Many of these activities simply would not happen without the support of the Music Centre.</p>

<h2>A Brief History of Townsville Community Music Centre</h2>
	<p><b>1990 -</b>This year the first lunchtime concert was held at the PercTucker Gallery. The importance of providing performance opportunities for emerging musicians had become evident and from this time, for a number of years, one of the major activities of the Centre was the production and management of concerts.</p>
	<p><b>1999 -</b>Arts Queensland had been a major funder of Music Centre activities for a number of years but in this year they agreed to provide funding on a three year basis. This made it much easier for the Centre to plan ahead and reduced the time that had to be spent on repetitive grant applications. This arrangement ran until 2004.</p>
	<p><b>2003 -</b>A spectacular variety concert was held at the Townsville Civic Theatre to celebrate twenty years of the Music Centre and as a tribute to Mary Lou.</p>
	<p><b>2005 -</b>The Centre moved to offices in the Old Magistrate's Court.</p>
	<p><b>2012 -</b>The Centre moved to its present office in the Townsville Civic Theatre building.</p>
